class Solution:
	'''
	Uses the two-pointer technique to find all unique triplets in quadratic time. First, the array is sorted, which takes O(nlogn) time. Then, the two-pointer technique
	is applied. The if statement after the first while statement ensures we do not redundantly re-check for identical values. Then, we compare triplets, and if greater than 0,
	decrease our right pointer, and if less than 0, increase our left pointer. If our triplet sum is equal to zero, then we add it to our outputs list. The two final while statements
	are necessary to ensure we do not include any repeated triplets. They each increment/decrement their respective pointer until a unique value is reached. Even if both are shifted, it
	doesn't skip any potential triplets since shifting only one to a new unique value guarantees that the sum won't be zero, since the other two values in the triplet are the same as before,
	where the sum was zero.

	Time Complexity: O(n^2)
	Space Complexity: O(1)

	My first attempt at a solution using a hashing method. First, we iterate through all unique pairs of indices and find the value that would complete their triplet. This value
	is used as a dictionary key, and the two indices that complete the triplet are stored as a corresponding value. These are stored in a list of nested tuples to ensure that the dictionary
	values are not overwritten when an identical match value is used.

	Then, we go linearly through each value in the array, and see if that value completes a triplet by checking if it is a key in the dictionary. If so, we take the list of index pairs
	that match this value and iterate through them. We use a list of sets to check if this triplet is unique, and if so, add it to our outputs.

	A more elegant version of the above hashing solution, that doesn't require a dictionary. For each index i, instantiate an empty set, and iterate through all remaining indices 
	that form a unique index pair that hasn't been visited yet. Calculate the value needed to complete the triplet at this unique pair. If that value is already in our set, ensure that the triplet
	is unique (using a list of sets), and if so, add it to our output list. If not, add the value at our second index to the set.
