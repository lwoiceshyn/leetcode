'''
Given a grid, of 'X', 'Y', and '0', find the shortest distance between any X and Y.

Example 1:

Input:
[[X,0,0],
 [0,Y,0],
 [X,Y,0]] 
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input:
[[X,X,0],
 [0,0,Y],
 [Y,0,0]] 
Output: 2

	Since all we care about is the shortest distance between any X-Y pair in the grid, we can
	do a simultaneous BFS from every X. As soon as any search encounters Y, then we know that this
	is the closest possible Y to any X.

	Time Complexity: O(m*n * Number_Xs)
	Space Complexity: O(m*n)
