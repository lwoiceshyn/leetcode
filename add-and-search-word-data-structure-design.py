class WordDictionary:
	'''
	Use a trie to represent all of the words that the the data structure contains, with the trie being
	represented by a dictionary of nested dictionaries. 

	For insertion, simply iterate through the characters in the word sequentially. If that
	character is already a key, then simply move to the next level of the dictionary by going
	to the nested dictionary at that letter. If not, create a new empty dictionary at that letter.
	At the end of the word, add in an end token at that level.

	In order to be able to search for any regular expression string where a period represents any
	possible character, we need to perform a recursive depth-first traversal through the trie. The 
	base case is such that we are calling the DFS function on an empty string. In this scenario,
	if the end token is in the current dictionary level we are at, we know that we've successfully
	found the word. 

	We use a class variable to store the status of our search to simplify things and not have to pass
	an extra argument through every recursive function call. If we reach the successful version of
	the base case at any point in the traversal, set the variable to True.

	During the traversal, if the current character is a period, then call the function recursively
	on all child characters of that node. Otherwise, if the current character is a child of the current
	node, call the function recursively on that node and the rest of the word we're searching for. If
	the current character is not a child of our node, then we've reached a dead end, so return nothing.
